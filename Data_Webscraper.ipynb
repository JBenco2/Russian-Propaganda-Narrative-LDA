Russian military forces remain in Novaya Kakhovka in the Kherson Region, Vladimir Saldo, the region\\'s acting governor, said on Thursday, adding that the information circulated by the Ukrainian army general staff was fake news.\\n\"I officially declare that all Russian troops in Novaya Kakhovka, as well as in other places of deployment on the left bank of the Dnieper River, remain in their positions. I think the fake news from our enemy’s general staff was motivated by the weak PR effect generated by [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky\\'s visit to the Kherson Region. They need more virtual victories,\" the acting governor wrote on his Telegram channel.\\nThe head of the Novaya Kakhovka municipal administration, Vladimir Leontiev, also dismissed reports about the withdrawal of Russian troops from the city. \"Ukrainian propagandists planted yet another fake story, claiming that units of the Russian Armed Forces were leaving Novaya Kakhovka,\" he said.\\n\"Naturally, this is a lie, which I state with full authority. However, today, indeed, something has disappeared from our city - the signal of Ukrainian mobile communications and radio, which the enemy was transmitting here from Berislav using a portable mobile system,\" he was quoted as saying on the Telegram channel of the Kherson Region administration. As became known from military sources, the transmission was knocked out by a direct hit.\\nLeontiev noted that all institutions and authorities in Novaya Kakhovka are operating on a routine basis. \"The administration’s employees will head to work in the morning, Novaya Kakhovka residents will receive their pensions and social benefits at the usual sites. Utilities and emergency services are on duty. There is enough work to do,\" he summed up.\\nMore than 20,000 residents remain in Novaya Kakhovka. Among them are many pensioners and people with low mobility. The city is shelled by Ukrainian artillery almost on a daily basis.'},\n",

Reports about Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s visit to the Kiev-controlled right bank of Dnieper in the Kherson Region are connected to Kiev’s intent to shift focus from the negative situation on the frontline and the new Russian-Chinese agreements, says Alexander Malkevich, advisor to the Acting Head of the Kherson Region.\\nEarlier on Thursday, Zelensky’s press office announced that the Ukrainian president visited Kherson, the settlement of Posad-Pokrovskoye and a regional power facility.\\n\"The Ukrainian people are extremely unlucky to have a president, whose entire point of existence is victories in the informational sphere. That is, when the situation on the frontline is difficult for Ukrainian armed forces, and when Russia signs long-term agreements with China, effectively defining the new system of international relations, Zelensky tries to force himself on agenda by his staged trips,\" Malkevich said.\\nHe also connected Zelensky’s trip to the preparation for the potential Ukrainian counteroffensive.\\n\"I would not be surprised if it [Zelensky’s trip - TASS] focused on preparation of another slaughter of people. Because Kiev desperately needs a counteroffensive for its report to Western puppeteers. Best-case scenario would be to show some success. Worst-case scenario: to force the West to ship new, more lethal weapons at the cost of deaths of its own soldiers. Kiev is not concerned over people’s lives - we have been seeing for a long time already,\" he said.'},\n",

Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev believes that it is inappropriate to talk about timeframes for the end of the special military operation, since such assessment could only be provided by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\"As for the timeframes, I hope that you do not expect me to give you an answer, because that would be inappropriate. Let us not get ahead of ourselves,\" Medvedev said in an interview for Russian mass media and social media users. He underscored that \"only the supreme commander-in-chief can give assessments of the progress or the timeframe.\"\\nAccording to the official, a lot of factors may affect the timeframe for the end of the special military operation.\\n\"I will only say what is obvious in itself: the Russian Federation is fighting not Ukraine, not the Ukrainian semi-Nazi or Nazi regime - our country is fighting the 3.6-million NATO army. They take part, of course, in this hybrid conflict, and they are effectively no longer hiding it,\" Medvedev said.\\nHe also noted that NATO is comprised of countries with a total population of 800 million people, and it is these countries that ship vehicles, ammunition and money to the Kiev regime.\\n\"They also do the training, they are about to come to begin deploying something, and so on,\" he added.\\nSpeaking about the results of the special operation, Medvedev noted that they stem from the President’s decisions.\\n\"It is necessary to achieve all goals on protection of our territories - that is, territories of the Russian Federation. It is necessary to throw away all foreigners present there in the wide sense of this word, to establish a buffer zone that will make it impossible to use any short-and medium-range weapons, meaning about 70-100 kilometers, to demilitarize it, if we talk about the military component. And, should it not be enough, then it would be necessary to make some other decisions,\" the politician said. \"Nothing could be ruled out here. Should it be necessary to reach Kiev, then we will have to go to Kiev; should it be necessary to reach Lvov, then we will have to go to Lvov in order to eradicate this contagion,\" he concluded.'},\n",

Ukraine is trying to intimidate the employees of the Zaporozhye NPP into committing sabotage, Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the CEO of the Rosenergoatom concern, told TASS on Wednesday.\\n\"Ukraine has greatly stepped up its psychological war against the employees of the Zaporozhye NPP.

By and large, this is a gross violation of one of the pillars of nuclear safety,\" he stressed.\\nRussia continues its policy of preserving the station\\'s workforce and improving their working conditions.\\n\"In the city salaries are being raised, social guarantees strengthened and medical care and education improved. We are establishing a peaceful life. This is the only way to counter Ukraine’s destructive activity,\" Karchaa added.\\nThe six-reactor 6-gigawatt Zaporozhye NPP, located in Energodar, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. At the end of February 2022, the facility was put under control by Russian forces. Since then, the Ukrainian army has periodically shelled both the residential areas of Energodar and the power plant’s premises using drones, heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. In most cases, the air defenses deflected the attacks, but on several occasions shells hit infrastructure and the nuclear waste storage area.'},\n",

The situation in Ukraine would have been peacefully resolved a long time ago had the US and its allies stopped flooding the Kiev regime with weapons, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said on Friday.\\n\"Peace could have been established in Ukraine a long time ago if the US and its allies had not flooded the Kiev regime with arms and had not forced it to toss thousands of new conscripts into the senseless slaughter,\" he said at a session of the UN Security Council.\\nThat said, the diplomat pointed out that the Ukrainian conflict would not have happened at all had Washington and its allies not organized a coup in Kiev in 2014. \"Russian tanks would not have come to Ukraine and Ukrainian soldiers would not have been dying for foreign, alien geopolitical interests if the US and its allies had not carried out an unconstitutional coup d’etat in Kiev in 2014 and brought Russophobes, nationalists and Nazis to power, had not armed them and readied them for war against Russia under the cover of the Minsk Accords,\" the Russian envoy noted. \"And had they not covered up their crimes against the Russian-speaking population in eastern and southern Ukraine,\" he added.\\nNebenzya stressed that Western countries are trying to impose on the international community a set of rules that benefit only them and, at the same time, do not consider themselves to have any obligations. \"The unscrupulousness and inconsistency of the collective West with regard both to the situation in Ukraine and to other international issues vividly illustrates the very essence of the so-called rules-based order, which has nothing to do with international law,\" he said. \"This way, Western countries are simply trying to impose their own rules that are beneficial only to them, in order to demand strict adherence to them from other countries. And, naturally, they do not consider themselves bound by any obligations whatsoever,\" the Russian diplomat concluded.'},\n",
