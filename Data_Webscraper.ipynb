Russian military forces remain in Novaya Kakhovka in the Kherson Region, Vladimir Saldo, the region\\'s acting governor, said on Thursday, adding that the information circulated by the Ukrainian army general staff was fake news.\\n\"I officially declare that all Russian troops in Novaya Kakhovka, as well as in other places of deployment on the left bank of the Dnieper River, remain in their positions. I think the fake news from our enemyâ€™s general staff was motivated by the weak PR effect generated by [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky\\'s visit to the Kherson Region. They need more virtual victories,\" the acting governor wrote on his Telegram channel.\\nThe head of the Novaya Kakhovka municipal administration, Vladimir Leontiev, also dismissed reports about the withdrawal of Russian troops from the city. \"Ukrainian propagandists planted yet another fake story, claiming that units of the Russian Armed Forces were leaving Novaya Kakhovka,\" he said.\\n\"Naturally, this is a lie, which I state with full authority. However, today, indeed, something has disappeared from our city - the signal of Ukrainian mobile communications and radio, which the enemy was transmitting here from Berislav using a portable mobile system,\" he was quoted as saying on the Telegram channel of the Kherson Region administration. As became known from military sources, the transmission was knocked out by a direct hit.\\nLeontiev noted that all institutions and authorities in Novaya Kakhovka are operating on a routine basis. \"The administrationâ€™s employees will head to work in the morning, Novaya Kakhovka residents will receive their pensions and social benefits at the usual sites. Utilities and emergency services are on duty. There is enough work to do,\" he summed up.\\nMore than 20,000 residents remain in Novaya Kakhovka. Among them are many pensioners and people with low mobility. The city is shelled by Ukrainian artillery almost on a daily basis.'},\n",

Reports about Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyâ€™s visit to the Kiev-controlled right bank of Dnieper in the Kherson Region are connected to Kievâ€™s intent to shift focus from the negative situation on the frontline and the new Russian-Chinese agreements, says Alexander Malkevich, advisor to the Acting Head of the Kherson Region.\\nEarlier on Thursday, Zelenskyâ€™s press office announced that the Ukrainian president visited Kherson, the settlement of Posad-Pokrovskoye and a regional power facility.\\n\"The Ukrainian people are extremely unlucky to have a president, whose entire point of existence is victories in the informational sphere. That is, when the situation on the frontline is difficult for Ukrainian armed forces, and when Russia signs long-term agreements with China, effectively defining the new system of international relations, Zelensky tries to force himself on agenda by his staged trips,\" Malkevich said.\\nHe also connected Zelenskyâ€™s trip to the preparation for the potential Ukrainian counteroffensive.\\n\"I would not be surprised if it [Zelenskyâ€™s trip - TASS] focused on preparation of another slaughter of people. Because Kiev desperately needs a counteroffensive for its report to Western puppeteers. Best-case scenario would be to show some success. Worst-case scenario: to force the West to ship new, more lethal weapons at the cost of deaths of its own soldiers. Kiev is not concerned over peopleâ€™s lives - we have been seeing for a long time already,\" he said.'},\n",

Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev believes that it is inappropriate to talk about timeframes for the end of the special military operation, since such assessment could only be provided by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\"As for the timeframes, I hope that you do not expect me to give you an answer, because that would be inappropriate. Let us not get ahead of ourselves,\" Medvedev said in an interview for Russian mass media and social media users. He underscored that \"only the supreme commander-in-chief can give assessments of the progress or the timeframe.\"\\nAccording to the official, a lot of factors may affect the timeframe for the end of the special military operation.\\n\"I will only say what is obvious in itself: the Russian Federation is fighting not Ukraine, not the Ukrainian semi-Nazi or Nazi regime - our country is fighting the 3.6-million NATO army. They take part, of course, in this hybrid conflict, and they are effectively no longer hiding it,\" Medvedev said.\\nHe also noted that NATO is comprised of countries with a total population of 800 million people, and it is these countries that ship vehicles, ammunition and money to the Kiev regime.\\n\"They also do the training, they are about to come to begin deploying something, and so on,\" he added.\\nSpeaking about the results of the special operation, Medvedev noted that they stem from the Presidentâ€™s decisions.\\n\"It is necessary to achieve all goals on protection of our territories - that is, territories of the Russian Federation. It is necessary to throw away all foreigners present there in the wide sense of this word, to establish a buffer zone that will make it impossible to use any short-and medium-range weapons, meaning about 70-100 kilometers, to demilitarize it, if we talk about the military component. And, should it not be enough, then it would be necessary to make some other decisions,\" the politician said. \"Nothing could be ruled out here. Should it be necessary to reach Kiev, then we will have to go to Kiev; should it be necessary to reach Lvov, then we will have to go to Lvov in order to eradicate this contagion,\" he concluded.'},\n",

Every trophy weapon improves our defense industry, helps us know our enemy, understand how and what to use to fight it. Everything that is obtained by our military-technical intelligence agencies will be studied. The Leopard and Abrams tanks are particularly interesting. Communications, security and guidance systems, installed on enemy vehicles, including these very tanks, pose very serious interest,\" he said, adding that \"everything related to radars\" is also interesting.\\nGagin noted that Russia is already in possession of numerous pieces of anti-tank weapons, small arms, armored vehicles and artillery.\\n\"The vehicles shipped by the West include some very mediocre ones that have no outstanding features. One such vehicle was recently seen near the city of Chasov Year - a Swiss-made Eagle armored automobile. Its specifications have been known for a long time already, there is no need to trophy it, it is no better than the Hummer or the Tigr. Just a generic automobile,\" the advisor added.\\nAfter the beginning of the Russian special military operation, the West has shipped billions of dollars worth of weapons and military vehicles to Kiev. Moscow repeatedly underscored that it views shipment of weapons to Kiev as an irresponsible step that leads to further escalation. Meanwhile, military experts note that Western states often ship obsolete pieces of equipment to Ukraine, replacing their own vehicles with newer ones.'},\n",

At the end of February 2022, the facility was put under control by Russian forces. Since then, the Ukrainian army has periodically shelled both the residential areas of Energodar and the power plantâ€™s premises using drones, heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. In most cases, the air defenses deflected the attacks, but on several occasions shells hit infrastructure and the nuclear waste storage area.'},\n",
